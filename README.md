🏠 HBnB - UML Documentation
Simplified AirBnB-like Application Design Team: Alexis Cornillon, Jules Moleins Project by: Javier Valenzani

📚 Project Overview
This project is the first phase of the HBnB Evolution application. The goal is to produce a complete UML-based technical documentation that will serve as the foundation for the system’s development.

We are designing an AirBnB-like system with support for user management, place listings, amenities, and reviews.

🧱 Application Architecture
The HBnB system follows a three-layer architecture:

Presentation Layer: Handles user interaction through APIs and services.
Business Logic Layer: Contains core models and domain logic.
Persistence Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval from the database.
All data is persisted in a database (to be specified in Part 3).

🧩 Entities & Business Rules
👤 User
Attributes: first_name, last_name, email, password, is_admin
Can: Register, update, delete
Identified by unique ID and tracked with creation/update timestamps
🏠 Place
Attributes: title, description, price, latitude, longitude
Linked to a user (owner)
Can: Create, update, delete, list
Can be associated with multiple amenities
🧼 Amenity
Attributes: name, description
Can: Create, update, delete, list
📝 Review
Attributes: rating, comment
Linked to a specific user and place
Can: Create, update, delete, list by place
All entities are timestamped and uniquely identified.

🗂️ Tasks
1. 📦 High-Level Package Diagram
Diagram showing the 3-layer architecture
Communication via Facade Pattern
2. 📐 Detailed Class Diagram (Business Logic Layer)
Covers: User, Place, Review, Amenity
Includes:
Attributes
Methods
Relationships (1:many, many:many, etc.)
3. 🔄 Sequence Diagrams for API Calls
At least 4 use cases, such as:
User Registration
Place Creation
Review Submission
Fetching Place List
4. 📄 Documentation Compilation
All diagrams + explanations gathered into a structured document
UML notation must be consistent and complete
🧭 Constraints
Use standard UML notation
Ensure clarity and accuracy across all diagrams
Business rules must be reflected in the class and sequence diagrams
Diagrams must be detailed enough to guide implementation
🛠️ Resources & Tools
